						<h2>Factbook</h2>
						<!-- introductory blurb -->
						<p>
							The UTSA Fact Book was designed by the Fact Book Committee, a sub-committee of the Data Council and serves as a primary resource for both our on and off campus constituents who use data about UTSA. The Fact Book is published every fall and contains data from the previous five years. The Fact Book provides an overview of the most frequently required data regarding the university.
						</p>
						<p>
							The  data in the Fact Book are based on reports certified by the Texas Higher  Education Coordinating Board, they do not include students enrolled in  self-supporting degree programs. For more information about self-supporting degree  programs please contact Institutional Research and Analysis at (210) 458-4706.
